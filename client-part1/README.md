# Client Part 1

This module will contain the first-stage multithreaded WebSocket client used to generate load against the Assignment 1 server.

## Planned Contents
- Maven or Gradle Java application packaging as an executable JAR
- Connection pooling and warmup phase (32 threads Ã— 1000 messages)
- Basic metrics logging (success/failure counts, throughput, runtime)

## Local Development TODO
1. Initialize the project scaffold with build tooling.
2. Implement message generation and sender thread coordination.
3. Add configuration support for server host/port and room selection.
4. Document build and run commands here once implementation is underway.
