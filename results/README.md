Store Assignment 1 evidence (logs, screenshots, metrics) in this directory.

## Suggested Layout
- `server/`: WebSocket + health endpoint evidence (local + EC2).
- `client-part1/`: Warm-up run logs, throughput screenshots.
- `client-part2/`: Metrics CSV, charts, analysis notes.
- `docs.md`: Quick summary of what each artifact demonstrates.

## Working Notes
- File names should describe **what** and **where** (e.g., `server/ec2-health-curl.txt`).
- Mask any sensitive information (private IPs, AWS account numbers).
- Update `docs.md` whenever new evidence is added so submission packaging is faster.
