# Client Part 2

This module will extend the Part 1 client with detailed performance analysis and reporting.

## Planned Contents
- Executable Java client with enhanced metrics instrumentation
- Per-message latency tracking and CSV export
- Statistical summaries (mean, median, p95, p99, min, max)
- Hooks for visualization (e.g., Python script or Java chart exporter)

## Local Development TODO
1. Branch from or reuse Part 1 codebase with shared libraries.
2. Integrate HDR Histogram or equivalent for percentile accuracy.
3. Generate CSV output and document schema in this file.
4. Add instructions for running analysis pipelines and producing charts.
